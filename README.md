# Page-Rank
A Java code for ranking pages

The above program takes user inputs as nodes and then ranks them using the very popular Page Rank Algorithm.
In the future, I will be uploading programs to convert a web page or a simple page into nodes so that we can easily convert the pages into nodes and rank them using the above program.

Any queries/doubt regarding the code?
Feel free to ping me up ant time. I will try to resolve it as soon as possible.
